        <h1>Why I Enjoy Summer</h1>
        <p>I enjoy summer for many reasons. Firstly, I love eating mangoes, ice cream and kulfis which are really tasty and also help beat the summer heat. The long days of summer allow me to spend ample time outdoors. Additionally, I spend countless hours playing soccer with my friends, which keeps me active and brings immense joy. I am a movie buff and I love the summer as I can watch as many movies as I want without having to worry about anything related to school. I enjoy playing in the sand at the beach during the summer. Summer is a great time to spend time with family and friends. You can have barbecues, play games outside, or just enjoy each other's company. Overall, summer is my favorite season.</p>
